# DNS 101

* **DNS** - Convert Human Friendly domain names into IP addresses
* IP4 \(32 bit\), IP6 \(128 bits\) - created to address exhaustion of IP addresses in IP4 space
* VPCs are now IP6 compatible
* Top level domains vs second level domains
* **Domain Registrars** - assign domain names under one or more top level domain names

### **Types of DNS Records**

1. SOA Record
2. NS Record - AWS is now a Domain Registrar as well
3. A Record - fundamental type of DNS record \(“A” stands for Address\). Used to translate the name of domain to the IP address
4. CNAME - Canonical - resolve one domain name to another. Can’t use CNAME for Naked domains.
5. ALIAS record - only on AWS - are used to map resource record sets in your hosted zone to ELBs, Cloud Front Distribution, or S3 buckets that are configured as websites. E.g. you can have DNS names which point to ELB domain names - w/o the need for changing IP when ELB Ip changes. Route 53 automatically recognizes changes in the record sets. Most common usage - map naked domain name \(zone apex\) to ELB names. Always use Alias vs CNAME as Alias has no charges. Answering CNAME queries has a cost on Route53
6. AAAA Record – Ipv6

**TTL** - Cache the DNS record for TTL seconds. Before DNS migration, shorten the TTLs - so no more responses are cached.

### **Hosted Zone**

Collection of resource record sets. NS, SOA, CNAME, Alias etc. types of records for a particular domain. e.g. [https://www.tcpiputils.com/dns-lookup/google.com/ALL](https://www.tcpiputils.com/dns-lookup/google.com/ALL)
