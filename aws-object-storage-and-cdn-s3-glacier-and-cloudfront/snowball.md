# Snowball

Next version of Import/Export Gateway. You could accelerate moving large amounts of data into and out of AWS using portable storage devices for transport. Ship the storage device â€“ no need to transfer over the internet. Problem arose with different types of disks.

### Snowball Edge

* 100 TB data transfer device which has onboard storage and compute capabilities
* Move large amounts of data in and out of AWS, as a temporary storage tier for large local datasets
* You can run Lambda functions
* Devices connect to existing applications and infrastructure using standard storage interfaces
* Snowball Edges can be clustered together to process your data on premise
