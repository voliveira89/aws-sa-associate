* You can force them to use CDN URL instead of S3 DNS
* To restrict bucket access you need to create origin access identity. And allow this user read permission S3 bucket content
* Set viewer protocol policy – redirect http to https, http or https
* Allows various HTTP methods – GET, PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE, and HEAD
* Restrict viewer access for S3 and CDN using pre-Signed URLs or Signed cookies. E.g. You can view video only using that URL
* Using Web Application Firewalls to prevent SQL injection, CSS attacks
* For https access, you can either use default CloudFront certificate or own certificate can be imported via ACM
