# Identity & Access Management

AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. Using IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources. 

IAM is a feature of your AWS account offered at no additional charge. You will be charged only for use of other AWS services by your users.
