# VPN Connections

You can connect your VPC to remote networks by using a VPN connection which can be **Direct Connect, IPsec VPN connection, AWS VPN CloudHub, or a third party software** VPN appliance.

* You can enable access to your network from your VPC by attaching a **virtual private gateway** to the VPC, creating a custom route table, updating your security group rules, and creating an AWS managed VPN connection
* A **customer gateway** is a physical device or software application on your side of the VPN connection
* To create a VPN connection, you must create a **customer gateway resource** in AWS, which provides information to AWS about your customer gateway device. Next, you have to setup an Internet-routable IP address \(static\) of the customer gateway's external interface
