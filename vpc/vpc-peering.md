# VPC Peering

* Connection between 2 VPCs that allows you to route traffic between two VPCs using private addresses, without the need to traverse the internet or any gateway
* You can create VPC peering between own VPC or between another account in the same region
* Ensure that the address space does not overlap
* **Daisy chaining of VPC connections not possible**. You need to setup individual connections between each VPC
* â€‹VPC peering does **not support edge to edge routing**.
