# Elastic IP

* An Elastic IP address is a static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing.
* An Elastic IP address is associated with your AWS account.
* With an Elastic IP address, you can mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your account.
* By default, all AWS accounts are limited to **five \(5\)** Elastic IP addresses per region, because public \(IPv4\) internet addresses are a scarce public resource.
* An Elastic IP address doesnâ€™t incur charges as long as the following conditions are true:
  * The Elastic IP address** is associated with an Amazon EC2 instance**.
  * The instance associated with the Elastic IP address **is running**.
  * The instance has only **one Elastic IP address attached to it**.
