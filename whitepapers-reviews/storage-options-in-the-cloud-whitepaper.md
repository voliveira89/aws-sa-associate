**Import/Export**

* AWS import/export accelerates moving large amounts of data into and out of AWS using portable storage devices for transport. AWS transfers your data directly onto and off of storage devices using Amazon’s high-speed internal network and bypassing the Internet. For significant datasets, AWS import/export is often faster than Internet transfer and more cost effective than upgrading your connectivity

**Storage Gateway**

* AWS Storage Gateway’s software appliance is available for download as a virtual machine image that you install on a host in your datacenter. Once you’ve installed your gateway and associated with your AWS account through our activation process, you can use the AWS Management Console to create either gateway-cached or gateway-stored volumes that can be mounted as iSCI devices by your on-premises applications
