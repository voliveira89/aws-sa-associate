# Enhanced Networking

Enhanced networking uses single root I/O virtualization \(SR-IOV\) to provide high-performance networking capabilities on supported instance types. SR-IOV is a method of device virtualization that provides higher I/O performance and lower CPU utilization when compared to traditional virtualized network interfaces. 

Enhanced networking provides: 

* Higher bandwidth
* Higher packet per second \(PPS\) performance
* Consistently lower inter-instance latencies
