* The **CloudWatch Logs agent** provides an automated way to send log data to CloudWatch Logs from Amazon EC2 instances. The agent is comprised of the following components:
  * A plug-in to the AWS CLI that pushes log data to CloudWatch Logs.
  * A script \(daemon\) that initiates the process to push data to CloudWatch Logs.
  * A cron job that ensures that the daemon is always running.
* **Basic monitoring every 5 minutes**
* **Detailed monitoring every 1 minute**
* If the AWS service supports both basic and detailed monitoring, the basic would be enabled by default and the detailed monitoring needs to be enabled for details metrics
* Retention schedules:
  * 1 minute datapoints are available for 15 days
  * 5 minute datapoints are available for 63 days
  * 1 hour datapoints are available for 455 days
