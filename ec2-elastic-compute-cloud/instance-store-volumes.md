* The virtual devices for instance store volumes are named as **ephemeral**
* If an instance reboots \(intentionally or unintentionally\), data in the instance store persists. However, data in the instance store is lost under the following circumstances:
  * The underlying disk drive fails
  * The instance **stops**
  * The instance **terminates**
