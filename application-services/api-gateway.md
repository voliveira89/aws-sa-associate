# API Gateway

* Managed web service which enables developers to publish, monitor and secure APIs at any scale
* Create an API that acts as front door for applications to access data, business logic or any functionality from your backend services
* All of the APIs created with Amazon API Gateway **expose HTTPS endpoints only**. Amazon API Gateway d**oes not support unencrypted \(HTTP\) endpoints**.
* **API Caching** – Cache your endpoint’s responses. Reduces load on endpoints based on duration of TTLs
* Low cost & Efficient. Scales.
* Throttle requests as required to prevent attacks
* Log requests to CloudWatch
* For application built on top of multiple domains, you need to enable CORS on API Gateway
