# Amazon EMR

Amazon EMR \(Elastic MapReduce\) provides a managed Hadoop framework that makes it easy, fast, and cost-effective to process vast amounts of data across dynamically scalable Amazon EC2 instances \(allows root access\). You can also run other popular distributed frameworks such as **Apache Spark, HBase, Presto, and Flink** in Amazon EMR, and interact with data in other AWS data stores such as** Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB**.

Amazon EMR securely and reliably handles a broad set of big data use cases, including log analysis, web indexing, data transformations \(ETL\), machine learning, financial analysis, scientific simulation, and bioinformatics.
