# Global Infrastructure

* A Region is geographical area consisting of 2 or more availability zones
* Availability zone is logical data center
* Edge Locations are CDN Endpoints for CloudFront. Many more edge locations exist than regions
* The AWS Cloud spans 54 Availability Zones within 18 geographic Regions and 1 Local Region around the world, with announced plans for 12 more Availability Zones and four more Regions in Bahrain, Hong Kong SAR, Sweden, and a second AWS GovCloud Region in the US.
* The names of the AZs are randomly applied. So a AZ for account A, maybe itâ€™s not the same for account B
