# Database Migration Service

Migrate production database to AWS. AWS manages all complexities of migration process. Source database remains fully operational. Both homogenous \(Oracle to Oracle\) as well as heterogeneous migrations are supported \(Oracle to Aurora or Microsoft SQL\). Can also be used for continuous data replication with high availability.

AWS Schema migration tool makes heterogeneous database - migrations - easy by automatically converting the source database schema and a majority of the custom code, including views, stored procedures, and functions, to a format compatible with the target database. Any code that cannot be automatically converted is clearly marked so that it can be manually converted.
