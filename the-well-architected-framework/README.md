# The Well Architected Framework

Framework developed by various SAs based on their experience with customers. It’s a set of questions to check how well aligned is your architecture to best practices.

**5 Pillars of WAF**

1. Security
2. Reliability
3. Performance Efficiency
4. Cost Optimization
5. Operational Excellence

Each Pillar has Design Principles, Definition, Best Practices, Key AWS Services these pillars apply to.

**General Design Principles**

1. Stop guessing your capacity needs
2. Test systems at production scale – Use Cloud Formation and test in other regions
3. Lower risk of architecture change
4. Automate to make architecture experimentation easier
5. Allow for evolutionary architectures. \(E.g. Physical servers earlier you are stuck with it but now Cloud you can move to newer cloud features as soon as they are available\)
